# Apertium

This is a placeholder for whatever we make the introductory and formal entry-point to Apertium's Github presence. We need a place to keep bylaws, global issues, and point people at the wiki, IRC, and mailing lists.

The repo name `organisation` can be bikeshedded. Feel free to do so on the Wiki or in an issue.
