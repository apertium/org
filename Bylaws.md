# Apertium Bylaws

## Mission

<ol start="1">
	<li>The mission of Apertium is to collaboratively develop free/open-source machine translation for as many languages as possible, and in particular:
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
			<li>To give everyone free, unlimited access to the best possible machine-translation technologies.</li>
			<li>To maintain a modular, documented, open platform for machine translation and other human language processing tasks.</li>
			<li>To favour the interchange and reuse of existing linguistic data.</li>
			<li>To make integration with other free/open-source technologies easier.</li>
			<li>To radically guarantee the reproducibility of machine translation and natural language processing research.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Users

<ol start="2">
	<li>The most important participants are people who use Apertium. The majority of our contributors start out as users and guide their development efforts from the user's perspective.</li>
	<li>Users contribute to Apertium by providing feedback to developers in the form of bug reports and feature suggestions. As well, users participate in the Apertium community by helping other users.</li>
</ol>

### Contributors and Contributions

<ol start="4">
	<li>Contributors are volunteers who contribute time, code, documentation, or resources to Apertium. A contributor that makes sustained, welcomed contributions to Apertium may be invited to become a Voting Member, though the exact timing of such invitations depends on many factors.</li>
	<li>Contributors who have administrative rights to a repository may exercise those rights almost fully, including granting rights to new contributors, making releases, or setting up automation. Potentially destructive or distruptive actions, such as deleting or renaming the repository or master branch, or breaking backwards compatibility, must be approved by a PMC member, who may decide the action requires a PMC vote.</li>
	<li>Apertium recommends, but does not require, that contributors sign the Apertium Open Source Contributor License Agreement. However, contributions that are not licensed to Apertium in this way must be clearly marked with a GPLv2+ compatible license, plus the author's name and email or other identifying information sufficient for a lawyer to reach the contributor.</li>
</ol>

### The Assembly of Voting Members

<ol start="7">
	<li>Voting Members may cast binding votes on any technical discussion regarding Apertium.</li>
	<li>The Voting Members of Apertium constitute the Assembly of Apertium.</li>
	<li>The Assembly of Apertium is the deciding body of Apertium.</li>
	<li>The Assembly elects the Project Management Committee of Apertium every two years, or whenever a vacancy occurs.</li>
	<li>One tenth of the Assembly may propose a motion of censure to overturn the Project Management Committee, which has to be approved by half plus one of the members of the Assembly.</li>
	<li>The number of members of the Assembly of Apertium does not have any limit.</li>
	<li>Voting Member status is received by contributing to Apertium and getting sponsorship either by a PMC member or two existing Voting Members. Upon fulfillment of these conditions, the PMC will vote whether to grant voting rights.</li>
	<li>A Voting Member is considered emeritus by their own declaration or by not contributing in any form to Apertium for at least two years. An emeritus Voting Member may request reinstatement of voting rights from the PMC.</li>
	<li>If a Voting Member acts against the mission or interests of Apertium, the PMC may suspend that member's access and voting rights. If suspended, the PMC must ask the Assembly to vote on whether to remove the member. If the Assembly does not vote to remove, the PMC must reinstate all access and voting rights.</li>
	<li>The President of the Project Management Committee will also act as President of the Assembly.</li>
	<li>The Assembly decides only on subjects proposed by the Project Management Committee.</li>
	<li>Once submitted to it, the decisions of the Assembly are executive.</li>
</ol>

		<li>All administrative access must be guarded by the best possible reasonable security practices. Where possible, multi-factor authentication and/or SSH keys must be used.</li>
		<li>Shared authentication tokens, passwords, and similar credentials shall at minimum be reset when a newly elected PMC starts to function, and optionally when a PMC member steps down or is removed.</li>

	</ol>
</ol>

## Election of the Project Management Committee

		</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

## Tied Votes

<ol start="30">
	<li>In the event of a tied vote, either by the Assembly or the PMC, the tie-breaker criteria should be to allow further discussion, if this is possible, and otherwise to vote in favour of the status quo. Which for elections means:
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>If the tie is between a current seat holder and a non-seated, the current seat holder should retain their seat.</li>
		<li>If the tie is between either two current seat holders or two non-seated, the seat should go to the person with seniority.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

## Transitional provisions

<ol start="31">
	<li>The initial Assembly of Voting Members consists of everyone who were eligible to vote in the March 2020 PMC election, minus those who have been inactive for over two years. Voting in the election shall count as being active for this purpose.</li>
</ol>
