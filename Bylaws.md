# Apertium Bylaws

## Mission

<ol start="1">
	<li>The mission of the Apertium project is to collaboratively develop free/open-source machine translation for as many languages as possible, and in particular:
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
			<li>To give everyone free, unlimited access to the best possible machine-translation technologies.</li>
			<li>To maintain a modular, documented, open platform for machine translation and other human language processing tasks.</li>
			<li>To favour the interchange and reuse of existing linguistic data.</li>
			<li>To make integration with other free/open-source technologies easier.</li>
			<li>To radically guarantee the reproducibility of machine translation and natural language processing research.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Users

<ol start="2">
	<li>The most important participants in the project are people who use Apertium. The majority of our contributors start out as users and guide their development efforts from the user's perspective.</li>
	<li>Users contribute to the Apertium project by providing feedback to developers in the form of bug reports and feature suggestions. As well, users participate in the Apertium community by helping other users.</li>
</ol>

### Contributors and Contributions

<ol start="4">
	<li>Contributors are volunteers who contribute time, code, documentation, or resources to Apertium. A contributor that makes sustained, welcomed contributions to the project may be invited to become a Voting Member, though the exact timing of such invitations depends on many factors.</li>
	<li>Contributors who have administrative rights to a repository may exercise those rights almost fully, including granting rights to new contributors, making releases, or set up automation. Potentially destructive or distruptive actions, such as deleting or renaming the repository or master branch, or breaking backwards compatibility, must be approved by a PMC member.</li>
	<li>Apertium recommends, but does not require, that contributors sign the Apertium Open Source Contributor License Agreement. However, contributions that are not licensed to Apertium in this way must be clearly marked with a GPLv2+ compatible license, plus the author's name and email or other identifying information sufficient for a lawyer to reach the contributor.</li>
</ol>

	<li>Voting Members may cast binding votes on any technical discussion regarding the project.</li>
	<li>The voting members of Apertium constitute the Assembly of Voting Members of Apertium.</li>

	<li>One tenth of the Assembly of Voting Members may propose a motion of censure to overturn the Project Management Committee, which has to be approved by half plus one of the members of the Assembly of Voting Members.</li>
	<li>The number of members of the Assembly of Voting Members of Apertium does not have any limit.</li>
	<li>Voting Member status is received by contributing to Apertium and getting sponsorship either by a PMC member or two existing Voting Members. Upon fulfillment of these conditions, the PMC will vote whether to grant voting rights.</li>
	<li>A Voting Member is considered emeritus by their own declaration or by not contributing in any form to the project for over twelwe months. An emeritus Voting Member may request reinstatement of voting rights from the PMC.</li>
	<li>The President and the Secretary of the Project Management Committee will also act as President and Secretary of the Assembly of Voting Members.</li>

	<li>The Project Management Committee votes on all of its decisions. The President has the casting vote.</li>
	<li>The Project Management Committee has the obligation to submit to the Assembly of Voting Members the decisions that affect the work of the half or more of the members of the Assembly of Voting Members.</li>
