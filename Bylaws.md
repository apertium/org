# Apertium Bylaws

## Mission

<ol start="1">
	<li>The mission of the Apertium project is to collaboratively develop free/open-source machine translation for as many languages as possible, and in particular:
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
			<li>To give everyone free, unlimited access to the best possible machine-translation technologies.</li>
			<li>To maintain a modular, documented, open platform for machine translation and other human language processing tasks</li>
